              <h1>Introducion</h1>
              <p>Hi, my name is Kevin and is a pleasure to receive you here. I'll tell you a little about myself: When I started my carrier, my habilities and objectives, etc. So sit back and enjoy it =D.</p>

              <h1>My carrier</h1>
              <p>I started my carrier how Support Techician when i was 13 years old, i worked formatting the computer's neighborhood, fixing some bugs and installing softwares.
              <p>When i was 16 years old, i begin my first professional job  in a law office called <span><a target="_blank" href="https://indaleciogomesneto.com.br/">Indalécio Gomes Neto Advogados & Associados</a></span>, my position was Xerox boy, but how i was trainee(or intern) i did all type of things that we need, some examples: External works, software's questions, hardware repairing and others. I had much luck to found that job, i loved my firts job so much.
              </p>
              <p>Still in my job at the law office, i participated of a test at the <span><a target="_blank" href="https://magius.com.br/">Magius Metalúrgica Industrial</a></span> for apprentice. Sometime later i was approved and started my second professional job, the Magius have internacional customers, so its for me was awesome. During my concract i knew a man called Paulo Fegueredo, he was very important for my third job.</p>
              <p>At the end of my concract at Magius, i didn't have any opportunity of job, untill i receive an indication of Paulo for freelance at the <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pucpr.br/">Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná (PUCPR)</a></span>, in about 10 days i stayed how freelance, but after this i receibe an opportunity to integrate the team, this was the biggest step in my carrier, 'cause the PUCPR is the biggest college of the Paraná State and i learned so much there. It was my best job until then.</p>
              <p>Some day i lost my mom, so my pessoal and professional life started getting so boring. i was no more happy with my first job and had so much problems with my family that i begin freaking out. Untill i decide go to Portugal to start my own life, when i was 20 years old. Now i'm working as waiter at the Capim Dourado, a restaurant with brazilian food in Porto, Portugal.</p>
              <p>Now i'm looking for new opportunities in IT jobs, i improved my english speaking, listening, talking so much and studied a lot for much time. 2024 is my year, i hope as soon i refresh this datas with my new job.</p>
              <p>This was just a little about my life history, if you'd like to talk to me or know a little more, you may go to the <span><a href="Pages/contact.html">contact </a></span>window and send me an E-mail. I will return ASAP.</p>
